 Introduction to Node.js: Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It uses the V8 JavaScript engine from Chrome and is designed to build scalable network applications. Node.js enables server-side programming with JavaScript, which was traditionally limited to client-side scripting.



 What is Node.js: Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server-side. It provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient for building data-intensive, real-time applications. Node.js is used to create web servers, APIs, and other types of backend services.



 Why use Node.js: Node.js is popular for several reasons:

 JavaScript Everywhere: Developers can use JavaScript for both frontend and backend, reducing the learning curve and enabling full-stack development with a single language.
 Scalability: Its event-driven architecture and asynchronous I/O operations allow Node.js applications to handle multiple concurrent connections efficiently.
 Large Ecosystem: Node.js has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks (like Express.js) that simplify development tasks.
 Performance: Built on the V8 engine, Node.js is known for its fast execution of JavaScript code.



 History of Node.js: Node.js was created by Ryan Dahl and initially released in 2009. It was built on the V8 JavaScript runtime from Chrome, aiming to provide an efficient way to build scalable network applications. Node.js gained popularity quickly due to its non-blocking I/O model and JavaScript's ubiquity. Over the years, it has evolved with regular updates and a vibrant community, becoming a cornerstone in modern web development.
