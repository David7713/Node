npm (Node Package Manager)
npm is a package manager for JavaScript that allows you to install, share, and manage dependencies (libraries and tools) for your projects.
You can use npm to install packages globally (available across all projects) or locally (available only within a specific project).
npx

npx is a tool that comes with npm (version 5.2.0 and higher) and allows you to execute npm packages without needing to install them globally. It's useful for running one-off commands.
Global Installation
Global Installation means installing a package so that it can be used from the command line anywhere on your system.
bash
npm install -g package-name
Example: npm install -g create-react-app


Local Installation
Local Installation means installing a package only for the current project. The package will be placed in the node_modules directory of your project.
bash
npm install package-name
Example: npm install lodash
